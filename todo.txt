We want 3 classes to create a basic overlay:

MainActivity
- Encompasses everything

Service
-This monitors the copy function
-Will have to look into service class

GetText
-Retrieve the text from the service
-Will have to look at Clipboard manager

Iteration 1 goals:
1) Get copy function working
2) Provide evidence (aka. print to log file)
3) Filter out anything not text (pictures, video)
4) Save a string
