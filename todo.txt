We want 3 classes to create a basic overlay:

MainActivity
- Encompasses everything

Service
-This monitors the copy function
-Will have to look into service class

GetText
-Retrieve the text from the service
-Will have to look at Clipboard manager

Iteration 1 goals:
1) Get copy function working
2) Provide evidence (aka. print to log file)
3) Filter out anything not text (pictures, video)
4) Save a string
5) Handle multiple copies and store them in memory

Iteration 2 goals:
1) Get primary listener a timer listener to indicate when the clipboard manager is updated
2) Get queue implemented
3) We should definitely try to get ahead by any means since our checklist is finished.
    Here are some iteration three requirements that we could get started on once the listener is finished:
    - allowing the user to determine the number of strings they want to have saved at any given time
    - creating the floating menu
    - working on making chippet quick and not detrimental to other activity or the battery


Todo:

UML diagram

Rethink about how to create class diagrams: Think about it in terms of inheritance, instances, etc.
Rethink use case diagrams. Another uses relationship?
