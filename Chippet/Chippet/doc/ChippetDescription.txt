Description

Chippet is a copy & paste application that continually runs in the background of your phone.

As you copy and cut, Chippet keeps a tab of each clip that you create.
Chippet works with all applications on your phone but can only stores clips that are text.

You are able to change the amount of clips that Chippet stores in the settings menu.
The default amount of clips that Chippet will save is one. The user can choose up to ten clips to be saved.

To paste, you can simply open Chippet and choose one of the saved clips to paste wherever you'd like.
The most recent clips are saved and the older ones are deleted ones Chippet reaches its maximum amount of saved clips.

Chippet will not slow down your phone or use excessive amounts of battery.

So no more of having only one clip to copy and paste at a time.
Try Chippet and make your life a bit easier!
